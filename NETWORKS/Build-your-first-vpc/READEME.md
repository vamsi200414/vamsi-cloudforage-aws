# Building VPC inside AWS Cloud Provider

## Goal

To understand and implement the foundational elements of networking in AWS by manually building a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with essential components using the AWS Management Console.

---

## Project Description

In this project, I perform a hands-on walkthrough to create basic networking infrastructure inside AWS. The steps include:

- Creating an Amazon VPC with a custom CIDR block  
- Creating a public subnet within the VPC  
- Attaching and configuring an Internet Gateway for public access  

This project helps me learn how cloud networking is designed, secured, and accessed.
